## a milje for your browser :)
adds a milje table cloth on top of your browser viewport, bringing a classic piece of geriatric balkan home decor straight to your screen

now at proof of concept stage!

huge thanks to [He4eT](https://github.com/He4eT) for squashing the research and development time from two weeks to a single evening

functions:
- place milje on the center top of the viewport
- makes you feel old

to move the milje away, simply disable the extension(why would you do that?)

todo list:
- [x] create a chrome version
- [ ] create a firefox version
- [ ] create customizable milje with a settings tab(basically just edit the size, change cloth design)
- [ ] render an actual cloth simulation instead of a fixed image using three.js
- [ ] somehow integrate with miljegen
